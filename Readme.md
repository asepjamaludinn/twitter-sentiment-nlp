# ðŸ§  Twitter Sentiment NLP Models

This project performs sentiment analysis on Twitter data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) models: **Naive Bayes** and **LSTM**. The tweets are classified into three sentiment categories: **positive**, **negative**, and **neutral**. The project also compares the performance of the models using standard evaluation metrics.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw Twitter text (tokenization, stop word removal, stemming/lemmatization)
- Validate or relabel sentiment labels if needed
- Train and evaluate Naive Bayes and LSTM models
- Compare model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualize sentiment distribution and model performance

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualizations

The project includes:

- Distribution plots of sentiment labels
- Confusion matrix for each model
- Bar charts comparing model metrics
